## Kaggle-query

### purpose
Make it cool and interesting to find a dataset for my next data project
### notes

current state: picks a random dataset and returns someattributes(like title and subtitle)

next steps:
- add a filter for size eg don't allow extremely large datasets to be returned(or make the size a parameter that can be set by the user)
- allow the user to describe the kind of project they want to do and combthrough the dataset descriptions on kaggle to find an appropriate short-list of matches
-download the dataset if the user accepts it
-automatically create a new folder with a git repository of the dataset.
